[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ooh, she wants me
But she won't give it away
So she taunts me
I'm too cool to break

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I gave her my heart and soul
She wants more
She tells me that she loves me
And I can't lie, I want her, but I will shoot her down

[Verse 2]
I'm cold-blooded
Got to keep moving
Moving on
It's gone too far
Woah, girl, for way, way too long

[Chorus 2]
I gave you my heart and soul
What more could you want
I know that you love me
You know that I want you, but I will shoot you down

[Bridge]
Hey, is that you outside my home
Girl you done got me terrified
Why don't you leave me alone
Your craziness is verified
It's kinda scary
Please, please
Please, please just leave me alone

[Chorus 3]
I done gave it all
What more, what more could you want
I know that you love me
I don't want to, but I got to shoot you down

[Outro]
Cold-blooded
I'm tired
I'm tired
