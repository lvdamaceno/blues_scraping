[Verse 1]
They told me that I needed some patience
But don't keep me waiting too long
They told me that I needed salvation
But who are we to lean on?

Something's going on here
Something's going wrong
Running out of time here
But I'm still waiting for something

It doesn't matter how high
As long as you're with me when we fall

[Pre-Chorus]
We're a step away from breaking down
I need something good

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, don't get me jumpin' for nothin'
Hey, hey, don't get me jumpin' for nothin'

[Verse 2]
The light is at the end of the tunnel
Or is it just a runaway train
My daddy told me, "Glitter ain't gold, young boy
So save yourself a whole lot of pain"
