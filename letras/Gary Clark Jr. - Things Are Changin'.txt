[Chorus-Gary Clark Jr]
Oh baby, things are changing now
And I can't tell where I'll be from here on out
Ooh, it's hell
Knowing that from now
We shouldn't kiss and tell
It's so good

[Verse 1-Gary Clark Jr]
You walk up to me like a stranger, girl
And I already know your name
I can make you feel good if you want
Give me the time of day
Well, you listen to me here and now
I'll lay you down simple and plain
Won't it be good to get together, girl?
But it'll be so hard to maintain
Cause it seems like now...

[Chorus-Gary Clark Jr]
Oh baby, things are changing now
And I can't tell where I'll be from here on out
Ooh, it's hell
Knowing that from now
We shouldn't kiss and tell
It's so good

[Verse 2-Gary Clark Jr]
I told you already, girl
That I was so gone
But that sweet, sweet loving
It had me hanging on, so strung out
I know now, girl
That I can stand alone
I was put here on this earth by myself
I gotta keep moving on
Cause it seems like now...
