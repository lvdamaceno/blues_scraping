[Verse 1]
I don't believe in competition
Ain't nobody else like me around
I don't need your inquisition
It ain't that hard to figure it out

[Chorus]
Give it up now
Play it cool
Give it up now
Play it cool
All the rules that you use and abusing
No one losing can take this confusion
Give it up now
Don't let me down

[Verse 2]
Don't think too much of my disposition
You already know what's going down
Don't wanna be your exhibition no
I don't want nobody hanging around

[Chorus]
Give it up now
Play it cool
Give it up now
Play it cool
All the rules that you use and abusing
No one losing can take this confusion
Give it up now
Don't let me down
Give it up now
Play it cool
Give it up yeah
Play it cool
All the rules that you use and abusing
No one losing can take this confusion
Give it up now
Don't let me down
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up now yeah yeah yeah
