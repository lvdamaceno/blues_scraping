[Verse 1]
When you're feeling down and out
When you're feeling black and blue
You should feel like you can come to me
And I'll tell you the truth

Yet somewhere we got twisted
How do we get lifted?
How did we not go insane?

For so long we've existed
Still we are resisted
Why is it we still remain?

[Chorus]
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me

[Verse 2]
They say you get just what you paid for
And that you reap just what you sow
So, you won't get everything you pray for
Surprises me that you don't know, by now

I need something to hold on to
While the world is spinning 'round and 'round
It could crumble any moment
I keep my feet on solid ground, for now

[Chorus]
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me

Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Father, don't leave me

[Chorus]
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
No I wonÂ´t leave you
Black and blue, yeah
