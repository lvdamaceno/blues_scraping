[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
It's been one of those days
Where things don't go my way
Ooh, and it seems like always
The thing to blame is my ways

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're the one I'm thinkin' of
The one I'm dreamin' of

[Chorus 1]
You are my lady
I am your man
Some call it crazy, but
They don't understand

[Verse 2]
When I'm gone
Baby, I'm always gone too long
That don't get your mind to wonderin'
If I still care, 'cause, baby, I still care

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're the one I'm thinkin' of
The one I'm dreamin' of is you

[Chorus 1]
You are my lady
I am your man
Some call it crazy, but
They don't understand

[Bridge]
Our love (ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, our)
Come on, babe (ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, our love)
Come on, babe (ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, our love)
(Ooh, ooh)
Yeah, yeah (ooh, our love)

[Chorus 2]
You are my lady
I am your man
Some call it crazy, baby
But they don't understand

[Outro]
This is our love
Yeah, yeah
This is our love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, girl
Let me be your man
Keep it together, babe
They don't have to understand
Our love
