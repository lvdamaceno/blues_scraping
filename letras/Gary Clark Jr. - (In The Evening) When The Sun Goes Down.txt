In the evenin', Mama, when the sun go down
In the evenin', Mama, when the sun go down
Ain't it so lonesome, ain't it so lonesome
When your love is not around when the sun goes down

Well, I lay awake at night
Well, I'm just thinkin' to myself
Oh, I lay awake at night
Oh, I'm just thinkin' to myself
Oh, don't it hurt so bad
When your love is lovin' someone else
When the sun goes down

When the sun rises in the east
When it sets down in the west
When the sun rises in the east, now, Mama
When it sets down in the west
Well it's harder till, it's harder till
Which woman'll love you the best
When the sun goes down

Last night, I were layin' sleepin'
I declare, I was sleepin' all by myself
Last night, I were layin' sleepin', darlin'
And I declare it was all by myself
Yeah but the one that I was really in love with
I declare she was sleepin' some place else
When the sun go down

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh, when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
