Well, my baby's gone
Won't be back no more
Well, my baby's gone
Won't be back no more
She left me soon this morning
Like she did the night before
I don't want no woman
One that treat me wrong all the time
I don't want no woman
One that treat me wrong all the time
Well, I got a me doin' baby
She 'bout to drive me out my mind
