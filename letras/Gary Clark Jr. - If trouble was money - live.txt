If trouble was money, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire
If trouble was money, babe, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire
If worries was dollar bills
I'd buy the whole world and have money to spare

Worry, worry, baby, I've had worries on my mind
I said, "Worry, worry, worry, baby
I've had worries all my life"
You know times is hard, baby, yeah, I swear, I don't tell you no lie

My mother used to tell me
She said, "Son, there gonna be days like this"
I said, "My mother used to tell me"
She said, "Son, there gonna be days like this"

She said, "I want you to always be a winner
I love you, son, I don't want you to quit"
