[Verse 1]
When I was younger
My days looked brighter
When you were around
You made me stronger
When you told me

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

[Verse 2]
As we grow older
I become wiser
I won't let you down
(I won't let you down)
I am determined[?] to see you shine on

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

[Bridge]
Know that you're a star
(I want you to shine)
I want you to shine
Go on and shine (Go one and shine)
I want you to shine (I want you to shine)

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

[Chorus 2]
They say that they gon' make you
Bigger than what you are
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 3]
Some will try to shake you
And some will try to break you
Just know that I'll be waitin'
While you quit chasin' new faces
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Some will try to shake you
And some will try to break you
Just know that I'll be waitin'
While you quit chasin' new faces

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

[Chorus 2]
Some will try to shake you
And some will try to break you
Just know that I'll be waitin'
While you quit chasin' new faces

[Refrain]
Everywhere you go
