[Verse 1]
It's taking me a little while to bounce back
I've been falling from something good
People say I took a little too long
Oh, I did, yeah

[Chorus]
Till you came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love

You came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love

[Verse 2]
It's taking me a little while to call back
I've been working on something good
So every now and then I tend to fall back
Oh Lord, I've been misunderstood

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You got it all, baby
I'm so addicted, I can't help but want it more
And more and more
You got it all, baby
I'm so addicted, I can't help but want it more
And more and more
