[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Verse 1]
I'm in love
With a woman
Who's in love
With a man
That I can't be
It ain't me

[Verse 2]
I was taught
To be patient
And I was taught
To be kind
But I unwind

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Verse 3]
I worked
Long hours
Now I'm drunk
And I'm stoned
I'm all alone
Miles from home

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand
