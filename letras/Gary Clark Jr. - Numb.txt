[Chorus]
Well, I'm numb
Yeah woman, I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah woman, I can't feel a thing

[Verse 1]
She give me hard time in the day
A hard time at night
She can be so sweet till she wanna fuss and fight

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ain't passing from the right
I'm passing to the left
Burn this whole thing down by myself
