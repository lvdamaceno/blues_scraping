[Intro 1]
I'm a hard-fightin' soldier
And I'm on the battlefield
Lord, I'm a hard-fightin' soldier
And I'm on the battlefield
I'm a hard-fightin' soldier
And I'm on the battlefield
I'll keep bringin' soul to Jesus
By the service

[Spoken]
The service
The service?
That I pray
The service is the part...

[Intro 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got something in motion
Something you can't see
It requires devotion
From those who truly believe
This is something you can't touch
This is something you feel, yeah
For some people it's too much
For some people it heals

[Chorus 1]
This music is my healing
This music is my healing
Lord knows I need some healing, Lord
Cause when this world upsets me
This music sets me free, yeah

[Verse 2]
We stand in formation
While they test and they see
They compile information
And try to make us believe
That there is something we can't touch
Something we'll never feel, but
When I feel like it's too much
This music always reveals

[Chorus 2]
This is our healing
This music is our healing
Lord knows we need some healing, yeah
Cause when this world upsets me
This music sets me free

[Bridge]
Lord only knows who will save us, who will save us now, while
They sit back and watch flowers turn to stone
We got this, we got this music (healing)
Yeah, we got this music (healing)
We got this music (healing)
We got this music, this music, yeah
We got this, we got this

[Outro]
We got this
We got this, we got this
(Healing)
Music, music, music
We got this music
We got this
We got this music
We got this music
